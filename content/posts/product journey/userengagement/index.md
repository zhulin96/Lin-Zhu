It is never too early to engage with potential users even before the product idea has been fully shaped. Thanks to the influence of socail media, it provides mutliple ways for the user interaction. But how to use the social media well on encouraging users to speak up?

Germany is facing the challenge of labour shoratge and introducing a series of immgration friendly policies to attract the skilled workers globally. As an experiment on building my own product, i want to catch the trend and use my career experience, german market undesrtanding, local connections and data analytic skill to build a product for expats who are looking for career opportunities in germany. The product could fill their information gap of job market and support to shift their careers up in germany. 

however, there are couple of questions stand out.
1. the idea of the product is not concrete, should it be a consultancy service, subscription service, or the mentor platform extra?
2. where to find my potential users? 
3. Do i understand my potential users'needs well?
4. will the people be willing to pay for the product?

and more...

In order to clarify these questions, i realized the importance on getting in touch with my target users as early as possible. And the way i can easily to approach them is via social media. 

I opened an account in chinese instagram and start to post my career insights also the german job information every week to the audience. With high possibility, the people who are interested in my post are also my potential users. Till now, i have been posted continously for four months , without using my personal network from other platforms, i got more than 150 followers, got personal dm, and created a community group.

## How i do it

### Gain followers
Before anyone gets to know me in the platform, i need to continuously post to attract the people with interests in career related topics and  hopefully to convince them to follow me. The number of likes the post gained is the barometer of the audience's favour regarding the topic, for example, the practical advices is far more popular than the personal career opinions. I also replied on these pratical posts to get the most of my followers. This helps me to set up my strategy on the topic selection in the future. the golden rule is as always that only good content can stand out.


### Build my community
with the growing of the followers, i need to find the way to get to know these followers and create the opportunity to talk with them. Building group chat is a common function existing in the social media platform. But how to persuade them to join my group chat without pain? In one of my post, i ask the audience to join my group chat in oder to get the free job description collection data from me. This is tried and true method in the marketing on retaining the customers. As i saw the people slowly join the group, i feel safer on keeping my followers and closer to my potential users.

### Vote or Discussion ? Initiate it
In the end, the most important point that i want to reach is getting future users' input. It is hard to make audiences to either leave their thoughts publicly or reach out to me individually. Creating a safe/comfortable circumstance encourages the people in the internet to speak their mind up. Such as anonymous vote when others selection can be visible only after the participation, or group discussion once one person joined, then others can be encouraged as well. As my interactions with my followers increase, so does the trust between us. It paves the way on the user engagement for the future.
