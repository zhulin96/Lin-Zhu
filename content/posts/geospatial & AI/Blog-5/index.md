A heatwave is always defined as an event that lasts at least 3 to 6 consecutive days when the daily max temperature exceeds a certain threshold (*90th percentile of max temperature during the studied time period*) and impacts more than 40,000km2 within a 4°x4° degree sliding window. Due to the intensified **climate change** and the **jet stream** disrupting the traditional global atmospheric circulation systems, the heatwave becomes more frequent and lasts longer.

Since the 2003 heatwave, Europe has seen a particularly strong increase in heat extremes and described as a **‘hot spot’** by climate scientists. In June and July 2022, heatwaves hit Europe again, and many countries including France, Spain, and Italy experienced record temperatures and struggled with deadly wildfires fueled by the hot-dry weather.

This article will

- summarize the facts from the 2022 European heatwave
- and discuss how the heatwave impacts the European economy

## The 2022 European Heatwave
### 1. Record Temperature in European Countries in July
1. On July 13, 45.7°C recorded in Almonte, Huelva, Spain.
2. On July 14, the highest temperature of 47°C was recorded in Pinhão, Santa Bárbara, Portugal
3. On July 18, France (La Roche Sur Yon, Pays de la Loire) recorded 41.5°C.
4. On July 19, the U.K. experienced the hottest day ever recorded as the temperature topped 40°C.

### 2. Widespread Wildfires

With stable dry and hot weather, multiple forest fires occurred in countries such as France, and Spain and force thousands of residents and tourists to flee. In some countries, the size of burnt areas in July is much larger than the maximum burnt area of the past five years at the same time period.

- **France**: In the southwestern Gironde region, the wildfire has destroyed nearly 20,800 hectares and caused nearly 37,000 people to be evacuated.
- **Spain**: More than 30 wildfires happened in Spain which was mainly distributed in Zamora, Galicia, Gredos mountain range, and Aragon. The total burnt area in June and July exceeds 20,0000 hectares.
- **Portugal**: The Algarve region and the districts of Leiria and Santarém are regions most affected by wildfires. In June and July, a total of more than 40,000 hectares were burnt by the wildfire.

### Economic Impact from Heatwaves
Heatwaves can cause a great impact on the economy directly or indirectly. **However, compared to events like storms, the economic cost of heatwave events is more difficult to be quantified.** According to the research from García-León D et al, the 2003 heatwave undermined Europe's economic growth by around 0.5% of **European GDP** in that year. In certain countries/regions like Croatia and Cyprus, the percentages were even over 1%. Based on The European Environment Agency (EEA) estimation, during the period 1980-2000, heat waves cost up to $71 billion in 32 European countries.

Meanwhile, the global warming confirmed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is forecasted to escalate the heatwave situation in the future. García-León et al predicted the heatwave will induce more losses in the next few decades in Europe steadily. If no mitigation or actions are taken from now, by **2060**, the loss will be almost five times the loss in the historical period 1981–2010.

How the heatwave triggers the economic loss? This article will discuss the causes from three perspectives:

- *decreased workability: employees being less productive during hot weather*
- *damaged agriculture and forestry industry*
- *the indirect impact through triggered hazards*

## 1. Decreased workability
The workability has been approved to decline as workers are exposed to greater heat stress. Under heat stress, workers can experience heat exhaustion and heat stroke and need to take longer rest and reduce their work intensity. This leads to reduced labor productivity and increased risk of temperature-related diseases in general. Especially in sectors such as **agriculture** and **construction**, where the operations mainly happen outdoors, the workability can be expected to significantly decrease during the heating season. Meanwhile, due to many service occupations like work in transportation and warehousing having limited access to air conditions, the labor productivity in the service sector can also get a great impact from the heat stress.

Estimating the loss from reduced workability by the heat stress is always difficult. According to the finding from Orlov et al, **in Europe**, the heatwaves in August 2003, July 2010, and July 2015 are estimated to cause direct losses between $41 and $90 per worker in the agriculture and construction sectors. To project the heatwave-induced loss of working hours in the future, Casanueva et al estimated that under RCP8.5, by the end of the twenty-first century, the working hours in Southern Europe will reduce at least 15% on average, and the number in some locations in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Cyprus can even reach more than 50%. The published report from International Labour Organization (ILO) says, under RCP2.6, the labor productivity in Nothern and Western Europe is negligibly affected by the rising temperature by 2030. In Southern Europe, the working hours will lose around 2% due to heat stress by 2030. However, the number can reach around 7% in Albania specifically.

## 2. Damaged agriculture and forestry industry
Many key crops such as corn, soy, and wheat are vulnerable to extreme heat. The heat can hit the crop production by shrinking the wheat kernels and raising their protein levels. Even though the crops are able to bear the heat, extremely dry and hot weather often results in droughts. The drought would dry the soil out, trigger plant diseases, and lead to crop shortfalls. In Italy, the agriculture union Coldiretti warned that drought is threatening 30% –40% of the national seasonal harvest this year. At the same time, droughts and high temperatures also fuel wildfires through the dried ground and vegetation. The spread of wildfires can destroy forests and farmland in a short period of time and causes loss.

JRC MARS Bulletin published by the EU’s Joint Research Center predicts, that due to the continuous dry and hot weather conditions, the yield of sunflower, Maize, and soya bean will sharply drop by around 8% to 9 % in 2022, which is well below the 5-year average. In several regions such as Germany, Slovenia, and Croatia, July’s heatwave coincided with the flowering stage, thus also reducing flower fertility.

As a result, the heatwave will further escalate the food price which has already been raised by the Ukraine war and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 3. The indirect impacts

Heatwaves can also have a negative impact on several industries such as transportation, energy, and tourism indirectly. Due to the heatwave and lack of rainfall during the summer months, the water level of Germany’s Rhine River, the country’s most important inland waterway, fell to “exceptionally low ” and became difficult for transportation. At the waypoint Kaub near Frankfurt, the water level even fell below 40cm on 14.08.2022. Many companies are required to reduce the shipload. A similar problem of the dried river for shipping already occurred in 2018, which was estimated to reduce German economic growth by 0.2%.

As for the energy industry, the heatwave can also affect it from multiple aspects. One is from the supplement of cooling water for power plants. Thermal power plants, whether coal-fired, gas-fired, or nuclear, all need a large amount of water to cool down. The intensified heatwave leads rivers to dry out and causes the issue that power plants need to shut down in response to a lack of cooling water from rivers. The other one is the reduced efficiency of solar panels by heatwaves. Solar panels will reduce less power when they have exposed to high temperatures. According to the U.S. solar supplier, due to the heatwave, the reduced production efficiency of solar panels can reach 10% — 25%.

Meanwhile, the tourism industry also suffered from the extremely hot weather and the travel pattern started to shift in Europe. The heatwave-fueled wildfires not only destroyed large-scaled vegetation but also damaged the railroad track and airport runway in mountains and nearby cities. It results in train/flight cancellation and delays. Besides, the giant cloud of smoke from wildfires can also cause a business interruption in nearby areas and let the tourism sector suffer heavy losses. Due to the high temperature, travelers also tend to adjust their travel plans by switching the destination, rescheduling the daytime trip, or postponing the trip to a cool season.

### End
It is clear that the heatwave will become more frequent and last longer in Europe in the future. Finding the adaptation and mitigation solution across multi-sectors to cope with the coming heatwave trend gets more important than ever.
