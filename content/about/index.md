My name is Lin Zhu and currently based in Munich, Germany. I am a trained Cartographer and Geospatial information specialist. Few years ago, i stepped into the insurance firm and have been titled with Catastrophe risk analyst. However, i see myself more as a product manager/enabler than an analyst, and i wish i could use tech to innovate this old industry.  

In my personal life, i like jogging, cycling and practicing pilate. 

## Why i start the site ?

First of all, branding myself. For a tech people, portfolio/blog website is one of the most effcient ways to show what i care and what i can do.

I also create tutorials on geospatial&coding for the people who needs.

With the growth of my interest in building product, i opened a space in this site to record my learning journey on product management.

Last but not least, a fully self-owned space to statisfy my desire to share to the world.
